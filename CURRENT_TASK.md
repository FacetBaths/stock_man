**Completed:** 2025-08-26 02:01 UTC
**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours

### SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- [x] ‚úÖ Audit all route files to identify auth middleware usage
- [x] ‚úÖ Replace any legacy auth.js imports with authEnhanced
- [x] ‚úÖ Ensure all routes use auth, requireWriteAccess, or requireRole as appropriate
- [x] ‚úÖ Remove legacy auth.js middleware file if it exists
- [x] ‚úÖ Test role-based permissions work correctly

### CURRENT ARCHITECTURE REVIEW:
**Before starting, document what EXISTS NOW:**
- authEnhanced middleware: Exists at /middleware/authEnhanced.js with auth, requireWriteAccess, requireRole
- Route files to audit: skus.js, inventory.js, tags.js, export.js, instances.js, categories.js, users.js
- UNKNOWN: Legacy auth.js middleware location and usage
- UNKNOWN: Which routes currently use legacy auth vs authEnhanced
- UNKNOWN: Current role-based permission implementation
- ANALYSIS NEEDED: Complete audit of all route authentication

### WORK LOG:
