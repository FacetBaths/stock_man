## üìã CURRENT TASK: Fix Critical Tag Fulfillment API Design Flaw

**Status:** üö® CRITICAL ISSUE DISCOVERED
**Previous Task:** Update CreateTagModal component - COMPLETED ‚úÖ 2025-08-26 18:21 UTC
**Discovered:** 2025-08-27 18:28 UTC

**BACKEND STATUS:** üéÜ FULLY COMPLETE AND TESTED!
- ‚úÖ All API endpoints working with authentication
- ‚úÖ AuditLog validation errors fixed
- ‚úÖ Security logging working properly  
- ‚úÖ Backend ready for frontend integration

### CRITICAL ISSUE DETAILS:
**Tag fulfillment API violates documented architecture:**
- Current: POST /api/tags/:id/fulfill accepts fulfillment_items with item_id but IGNORES them
- Current: Calls tag.fulfillItems() which fulfills ALL items, not specific instances
- Expected: Should delete only specific Instance records by ID as documented
- Problem: API validates item_id parameter but doesn't use it (lines 862, 888 in tags.js)
- Impact: Frontend sends specific instance IDs but backend fulfills everything

### SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- [ ] üîç Analyze current fulfill endpoint implementation in tags.js
- [ ] üìù Identify specific code changes needed
- [ ] üîß Rewrite fulfill endpoint to use specific Instance IDs
- [ ] üóëÔ∏è Implement Instance.findByIdAndDelete() for each item_id
- [ ] ‚ö° Update inventory quantities properly after specific deletions
- [ ] üß™ Test fulfillment with specific instance selection
- [ ] ‚úÖ Verify frontend/backend integration works correctly

### DEPENDENCIES VERIFIED:
- [x] ‚úÖ Backend server running and healthy
- [x] ‚úÖ All API endpoints tested and working
- [x] ‚úÖ BACKEND_API_REFERENCE.md created with exact structure
- [x] ‚úÖ TypeScript interfaces updated to match backend exactly
- [x] ‚úÖ Pinia stores updated to use correct endpoints
- [x] ‚úÖ Current AddItemModal.vue component analyzed

### CURRENT ARCHITECTURE REVIEW:
**CreateTagModal migration to new tag system:**
- Current: May use legacy item-based tag creation
- Update: Use SKU-based tags with Instance selection
- New Structure: sku_items array with SKU references (not item references)
- Instance Selection: Choose specific instances for tag allocation
- Selection Logic: FIFO (first-in-first-out) vs cost-based selection
- API: Use POST /api/tags with new sku_items structure
- Critical: Must work with SKU selection and available Instance allocation
- Backend Logic: Tag creation moves instances from available to tagged status
- Tag Types: reserved, broken, imperfect, loaned, stock

### WORK LOG:
```
[18:01] - AddItemModal ‚Üí AddStockModal task COMPLETED
[18:21] - CreateTagModal component COMPLETED
           - All success criteria met and verified
           - Backend integration tested with real data
           - FIFO and cost-based selection working
           - Tag creation API verified with TOILET-751131
[18:28] - CRITICAL API DESIGN FLAW DISCOVERED during FulfillTagsDialog work
           - Tag fulfillment endpoint ignores specific instance IDs
           - Violates ARCHITECTURE.md and BACKEND_API_REFERENCE.md specs
           - Added to PROGRESS.txt as critical issue
           - Frontend sends instance IDs but backend fulfills everything
[TIME] - Analyze current fulfill endpoint (POST /api/tags/:id/fulfill)
[TIME] - Implement instance-specific deletion logic
[TIME] - Test fulfillment with selected instances
[TIME] - Verify proper inventory quantity updates
```

### CREATE TAG MODAL CHECKLIST:
- [ ] Read current CreateTagModal.vue implementation
- [ ] Analyze current tag creation data flow
- [ ] Update SKU selection to show available quantities
- [ ] Add instance selection logic (FIFO vs cost-based)
- [ ] Update form to use sku_items structure
- [ ] Update API calls to use new tag endpoints
- [ ] Remove legacy item-based references
- [ ] Test tag creation with real backend data

### BEFORE MARKING COMPLETE:
- [ ] All success criteria met
- [ ] Component shows available instances correctly
- [ ] FIFO vs cost-based selection implemented
- [ ] Tag creation uses new sku_items structure
- [ ] Uses new tag API endpoints correctly
- [ ] Legacy item-based references removed
- [ ] Real backend tag creation verified
- [ ] PROGRESS.txt updated
- [ ] Changes committed with checklist reference
- [ ] Next task identified

## üö® SCOPE CREEP ALERTS:

**If you want to work on something NOT in success criteria:**
1. STOP what you're doing
2. Add new item to MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md
3. Continue with current task ONLY
4. Address new item in proper order later

**If you find missing dependencies:**
1. Document what's missing above
2. Check if it's already in checklist
3. If not, add to checklist
4. Complete dependencies FIRST before returning to this task
