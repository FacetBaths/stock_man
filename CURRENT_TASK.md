## 📋 CURRENT TASK: Update CreateTagModal component

**Status:** READY TO START 🚀
**Previous Task:** Update AddItemModal → AddStockModal - COMPLETED ✅ 2025-08-26 18:01 UTC
**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours

**BACKEND STATUS:** 🎆 FULLY COMPLETE AND TESTED!
- ✅ All API endpoints working with authentication

- ✅ Security logging working properly  
- ✅ Backend ready for frontend integration

### SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- [ ] 📝 Read current CreateTagModal.vue component structure
- [ ] 💯 Show available instances for selection instead of legacy items
- [ ] 🎯 Implement FIFO vs cost-based instance selection logic
- [ ] 🏗️ Update to work with new SKU/Instance-based tag structure
- [ ] 📡 Update to use new tag API endpoints (POST /api/tags)
- [ ] 🗿️ Remove legacy item-based tag creation fields
- [ ] 🚀 Test component works with backend tag/instance endpoints
- [ ] ✅ Verify tag creation works with real SKU and Instance data

### DEPENDENCIES VERIFIED:
- [x] ✅ Backend server running and healthy
- [x] ✅ All API endpoints tested and working
- [x] ✅ BACKEND_API_REFERENCE.md created with exact structure
- [x] ✅ TypeScript interfaces updated to match backend exactly
- [x] ✅ Pinia stores updated to use correct endpoints
- [x] ✅ Current AddItemModal.vue component analyzed

### CURRENT ARCHITECTURE REVIEW:
**CreateTagModal migration to new tag system:**
- Current: May use legacy item-based tag creation
- Update: Use SKU-based tags with Instance selection
- New Structure: sku_items array with SKU references (not item references)
- Instance Selection: Choose specific instances for tag allocation
- Selection Logic: FIFO (first-in-first-out) vs cost-based selection
- API: Use POST /api/tags with new sku_items structure
- Critical: Must work with SKU selection and available Instance allocation
- Backend Logic: Tag creation moves instances from available to tagged status
- Tag Types: reserved, broken, imperfect, loaned, stock
