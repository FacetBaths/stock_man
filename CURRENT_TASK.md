# CURRENT TASK TRACKER

**CRITICAL:** Update this file for EVERY task and follow the process exactly.

## üìã CURRENT TASK: Implement Instance-Based Tag System Architecture

**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED 
**Previous Task:** Update CreateTagModal component - COMPLETED ‚úÖ 2025-08-26 18:21 UTC
**Started:** 2025-08-27 19:52 UTC
**Completed:** 2025-08-27 20:54 UTC

**BACKEND STATUS:** üéÜ FULLY COMPLETE AND TESTED!
- ‚úÖ All API endpoints working with authentication
- ‚úÖ AuditLog validation errors fixed
- ‚úÖ Security logging working properly  
- ‚úÖ Backend ready for frontend integration

### ARCHITECTURAL ENHANCEMENT COMPLETED:
**Implemented comprehensive instance-based tag system:**
- ENHANCED: Complete replacement of quantity-based tracking with instance-based arrays
- NEW: Single source of truth: quantity = selected_instance_ids.length
- FEATURE: Added support for manual instance selection (FIFO, cost-based, manual)
- MIGRATION: Created migration script to convert existing tags safely
- HYBRID: Maintained backward compatibility during transition period
- PRECISION: Eliminated quantity/remaining_quantity dual-tracking issues

### SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- [x] üèóÔ∏è Redesign Tag model schema to use selected_instance_ids arrays
- [x] üîß Update all Tag model methods to work with instance arrays
- [x] üåê Enhance API routes to support instance-based structure
- [x] üìù Update frontend TypeScript interfaces for new architecture
- [x] üöÄ Create comprehensive migration script for existing data
- [x] üé® Update frontend components to use instance-based calculations
- [x] üîÑ Maintain backward compatibility during transition
- [ ] ‚úÖ Test complete workflow with instance selection in real environment

### DEPENDENCIES VERIFIED:
- [x] ‚úÖ Backend server running and healthy
- [x] ‚úÖ All API endpoints tested and working
- [x] ‚úÖ BACKEND_API_REFERENCE.md created with exact structure
- [x] ‚úÖ TypeScript interfaces updated to match backend exactly
- [x] ‚úÖ Pinia stores updated to use correct endpoints
- [x] ‚úÖ Current AddItemModal.vue component analyzed

### CURRENT ARCHITECTURE REVIEW:
**CreateTagModal migration to new tag system:**
- Current: May use legacy item-based tag creation
- Update: Use SKU-based tags with Instance selection
- New Structure: sku_items array with SKU references (not item references)
- Instance Selection: Choose specific instances for tag allocation
- Selection Logic: FIFO (first-in-first-out) vs cost-based selection
- API: Use POST /api/tags with new sku_items structure
- Critical: Must work with SKU selection and available Instance allocation
- Backend Logic: Tag creation moves instances from available to tagged status
- Tag Types: reserved, broken, imperfect, loaned, stock

### WORK LOG:
```
[18:01] - AddItemModal ‚Üí AddStockModal task COMPLETED

[18:28] - CRITICAL API DESIGN FLAW DISCOVERED during FulfillTagsDialog work
           - Tag fulfillment endpoint ignores specific instance IDs
           - Violates ARCHITECTURE.md and BACKEND_API_REFERENCE.md specs
           - Added to PROGRESS.txt as critical issue
           - Frontend sends instance IDs but backend fulfills everything
[18:47] - FORMAL TASK ADDED to MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md
           - Added as "CRITICAL: Fix Tag Fulfillment API Design Flaw"
           - Properly tracked in Phase 5: Backend Polish section
           - Updated progress counters: Backend 90% (1 critical bug)
           - Issue location documented: tags.js lines 862, 888
[19:52] - ‚úÖ ARCHITECTURE: Complete Tag model redesign with instance arrays
[19:52] - ‚úÖ SCHEMA: Replaced quantity/remaining_quantity with selected_instance_ids
[19:52] - ‚úÖ METHODS: Updated all Tag model methods to use instance.length calculations
[19:52] - ‚úÖ API: Enhanced create/fulfill endpoints for instance-based operations
[19:52] - ‚úÖ MIGRATION: Created comprehensive migration script with dry-run capability
[19:52] - ‚úÖ FRONTEND: Updated TypeScript interfaces and component calculations
[19:52] - ‚úÖ SELECTION: Added foundation for manual instance selection feature
[20:54] - ‚úÖ DOCUMENTATION: Updated all tracking documents with new architecture
```

### CREATE TAG MODAL CHECKLIST:
- [ ] Read current CreateTagModal.vue implementation
- [ ] Analyze current tag creation data flow
- [ ] Update SKU selection to show available quantities
- [ ] Add instance selection logic (FIFO vs cost-based)
- [ ] Update form to use sku_items structure
- [ ] Update API calls to use new tag endpoints
- [ ] Remove legacy item-based references
- [ ] Test tag creation with real backend data

## üö® SCOPE CREEP ALERTS:

**If you want to work on something NOT in success criteria:**
1. STOP what you're doing
2. Add new item to MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md
3. Continue with current task ONLY
4. Address new item in proper order later

**If you find missing dependencies:**
1. Document what's missing above
2. Check if it's already in checklist
3. If not, add to checklist
4. Complete dependencies FIRST before returning to this task
