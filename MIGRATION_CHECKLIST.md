## üö® CRITICAL NEXT STEPS:
1. **Performance optimization** - complete backend before frontend migration
2. **Begin frontend migration** once backend is fully stable

## üìù Notes:
- Instance model successfully replaces complex Item model
- Cost tracking now works at individual instance level
- Repository structure is clean and organized
- Need to focus on completing backend before frontend migration
