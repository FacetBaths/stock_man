DATABASE CONVERSION: 0/1 Tasks Complete (0%)
============================================
‚ùå Create db_conversion utility (CRITICAL - run after all other tasks)

TESTING & DEPLOYMENT: 0/3 Tasks Complete (0%)
=============================================
‚ùå End-to-end testing
‚ùå Deployment verification
‚ùå Production database conversion

OVERALL: 14/22 Tasks Complete (64%)

NEXT IMMEDIATE TASK: Fix category dropdown issue

NOTE: Category display issue discovered - TEST TOILET shows "Unknown Category" in inventory table.
      This indicates a problem with SKU-to-category relationship display in the frontend.
      Added to MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md as separate task for investigation.

‚úÖ Backend server running properly (port 5000)
‚úÖ CreateTagModalNew component updated to new architecture  
‚úÖ Tag creation tested with real backend integration
‚úÖ FIFO selection method verified working
‚úÖ Cost-based selection method verified working
‚úÖ All API calls working correctly with sku_items structure

üö® CRITICAL BACKEND API DESIGN FLAW DISCOVERED - 2025-08-27 18:28 UTC
================================================================
‚ùå Tag fulfillment API violates documented architecture (ARCHITECTURE.md & BACKEND_API_REFERENCE.md)
   - Current: POST /api/tags/:id/fulfill accepts fulfillment_items with item_id but IGNORES them
   - Current: Calls tag.fulfillItems() which fulfills ALL items, not specific instances
   - Expected: Should delete only specific Instance records by ID as documented
   - Problem: API validates item_id parameter but doesn't use it (lines 862, 888 in tags.js)
   - Impact: Frontend sends specific instance IDs but backend fulfills everything
   - Fix Required: Rewrite fulfill endpoint to use Instance.findByIdAndDelete() for each item_id
   - Architecture Violation: Documents specify "scan barcodes" and "delete assigned instances"
   - This breaks the documented workflow where warehouse managers confirm physical items

NOTE: db_conversion utility will map legacy Items ‚Üí Instances with costs,
      convert Tags to SKU-based, handle conflicts, prompt for missing data
