DATABASE CONVERSION: 0/1 Tasks Complete (0%)
============================================
❌ Create db_conversion utility (CRITICAL - run after all other tasks)

TESTING & DEPLOYMENT: 0/3 Tasks Complete (0%)
=============================================
❌ End-to-end testing
❌ Deployment verification
❌ Production database conversion

OVERALL: 16/24 Tasks Complete (67%)

NEXT IMMEDIATE TASK: Complete remaining frontend component migrations

NOTE: Category display issue discovered - TEST TOILET shows "Unknown Category" in inventory table.
      This indicates a problem with SKU-to-category relationship display in the frontend.
      Added to MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md as separate task for investigation.

SUCCESS: CreateTagModal migration fully completed and tested!
✅ Fixed infinite loop (filters object reference stability)
✅ Backend server running properly (port 5000)
✅ CreateTagModalNew component updated to new architecture  
✅ Tag creation tested with real backend integration

✅ All API calls working correctly with sku_items structure

🏗️ MAJOR ARCHITECTURAL ENHANCEMENT COMPLETED - 2025-08-27 20:54 UTC
================================================================
✅ Instance-Based Tag System Architecture implemented successfully
   - ENHANCED: Complete Tag model redesign using selected_instance_ids arrays
   - RESOLVED: Eliminated quantity/remaining_quantity dual-tracking confusion
   - PRECISION: Single source of truth - quantity = selected_instance_ids.length
   - MIGRATION: Created comprehensive migration script for existing tag data conversion
   - SELECTION: Added foundation for manual instance selection (FIFO, cost-based, manual)
   - COMPATIBILITY: Maintained backward compatibility during transition period
   - FOUNDATION: Enables advanced inventory management and precise instance tracking
   - BENEFIT: No more quantity mismatch issues, precise fulfillment control
   - FILES: Updated Tag.js model, tags.js routes, frontend interfaces and components
   - IMPACT: Major architectural improvement enabling next-generation inventory features
   - DOCUMENTATION: Updated ARCHITECTURE.md and BACKEND_API_REFERENCE.md with instance-based contracts
   - DIRECTORY: Updated DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md with current project state and next steps
   - PROTOCOL: Executed VUMO Protocol verification - all success criteria validated with evidence

NOTE: db_conversion utility will map legacy Items → Instances with costs,
      convert Tags to SKU-based, handle conflicts, prompt for missing data
