# VUMO PROTOCOL WITH MANDATORY EVIDENCE
**Verify, Update, Move On - WITH PROOF FOR EVERY CLAIM**

## üö® CORE PRINCIPLE: HONESTY FIRST
**NEVER claim to have done something you didn't actually do.**
**If you didn't do it, say "I didn't do X" - don't lie.**

## üìã VUMO STEPS WITH EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS

### PRE-STEP: Ensure all Node Servers are killed from testing.
This prevents wasted time trying to start a dev server and getting an Adress In Use Error.
backend is localhost:5000/ frontend is supposed to be localhost:3000/


### 1. ‚úÖ Show evidence all current success criteria are met
**MANDATORY EVIDENCE:**
*You can ask the user if this has already been satisfied if you just showed proof.*
- For each success criteria checkbox, provide SPECIFIC PROOF:
  - Code analysis: Show exact file paths, line numbers, function names
  - API testing: Show actual curl commands and JSON responses
  - Build testing: Show actual command output (exit codes, error messages)
  - File existence: Show file paths and content snippets
- **NO GENERIC CLAIMS ALLOWED** - "I tested it" is INVALID
- **MUST BE VERIFIABLE** - Another person could check your evidence

### 2. ‚úÖ Update PROGRESS.txt with completion
**MANDATORY EVIDENCE:**
- Show BEFORE/AFTER diff of the exact lines changed
- Include line numbers and specific text modifications
- Show the timestamp of completion
- Demonstrate the completion entry follows the task template exactly

### 3. ‚úÖ Update MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md with completion  
**MANDATORY EVIDENCE:**
- Show checkbox state changes: `[ ]` ‚Üí `[x]`
- Show status changes: `NOT STARTED ‚ùå` ‚Üí `COMPLETE ‚úÖ`
- Show progress count updates: `2/10` ‚Üí `3/10`
- Include exact line numbers of all changes

### 4. ‚úÖ Update CURRENT_TASK.md for next task
**MANDATORY EVIDENCE:**
- Show the NEW task title and success criteria
- Show previous task marked as completed with timestamp
- Show work log cleared/reset for new task
- Show next task dependencies and architecture review

### 5. ‚úÖ Review WORKFLOW_DISCIPLINE.md & dev/documents/BACKEND_API_REFERENCE.md
**MANDATORY EVIDENCE:**
- WORKFLOW_DISCIPLINE.md: Must include signature `1234` 
- ACCOUNTABILITY.md: Must include signature `54Accountable`
- BACKEND_API_REFERENCE.md: Must reference specific API endpoints relevant to current task
- Show understanding of key rules (e.g., "Never modify backend during frontend work")

### 6. ‚úÖ Git Add, Commit, and Push All Changes
**MANDATORY EVIDENCE:**
- Show `git add .` command execution
- Make sure to not commit any sensitive data, API Keys, Passwords used in Production, etc.
- Show complete commit message with task reference
- Show commit hash from successful commit
- Show push confirmation with branch name
- All evidence must be actual command output, not claims

### 7. ‚úÖ Start working on next task immediately  
**MANDATORY EVIDENCE:**
- Show first success criteria of new task completed with proof
- Show analysis of current architecture/files for new task
- Show specific file paths and content relevant to new task
- Demonstrate actual progress, not just setup

## üö´ INVALID EVIDENCE EXAMPLES

‚ùå "I tested the component" ‚Üí INVALID (no specifics)
‚ùå "I updated the file" ‚Üí INVALID (no diff shown)  
‚ùå "I reviewed the documentation" ‚Üí INVALID (no signature)
‚ùå "The build passed" ‚Üí INVALID (no command output)
‚ùå "I checked the API" ‚Üí INVALID (no request/response)

## ‚úÖ VALID EVIDENCE EXAMPLES

‚úÖ "I tested GET /api/inventory - returned 200 with {inventory: [{sku_code: 'TOILET-751131'}]}"
‚úÖ "I updated PROGRESS.txt line 54: '2/10 Tasks Complete' ‚Üí '3/10 Tasks Complete'"
‚úÖ "I reviewed WORKFLOW_DISCIPLINE.md - signature: 1234"  
‚úÖ "Build passed: `npm run build` exited with code 0, output: '‚úì built in 2.74s'"
‚úÖ "I analyzed AddItemModal.vue lines 119-124: calls `inventoryStore.createItem(formData.value)`"

## üéØ ENFORCEMENT RULES

1. **ANY CLAIM WITHOUT EVIDENCE = TASK FAILS**
2. **Evidence must be SPECIFIC and VERIFIABLE**  
3. **No generic statements allowed**
4. **If you can't provide evidence, admit you didn't do it**
5. **Honesty is more important than looking competent**

## üí° REMEMBER
The point isn't to make more work - it's to ensure what we claim to do actually gets done. Evidence prevents lies and catches mistakes before they compound.
