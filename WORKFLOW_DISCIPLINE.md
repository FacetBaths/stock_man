# Workflow Discipline Guide

**Purpose:** Prevent scope creep, maintain focus, and ensure systematic completion of migration tasks.

## üö® **CRITICAL RULES - NEVER BREAK THESE:**

### 1. **ONE TASK AT A TIME RULE**
- ‚ùå **NEVER** work on multiple checklist items simultaneously
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** complete current task before moving to next
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** update PROGRESS.txt immediately after completion
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** commit changes with reference to specific checklist item

### 2. **BACKEND-FIRST RULE**  
- ‚ùå **NEVER** touch frontend until ALL backend tasks are complete and tested
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** verify backend API endpoints work before frontend migration
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** test with actual HTTP requests (curl/Postman) before frontend work

### 2.1 **FRONTEND ADAPTATION RULE** üö®
- ‚ùå **NEVER** modify backend models, routes, or API responses during frontend work
- ‚ùå **NEVER** add backend endpoints to fit frontend preferences
- ‚ùå **NEVER** change database schema for frontend convenience
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** adapt frontend to match EXACT backend structure
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** reference BACKEND_API_REFERENCE.md before frontend changes
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** use exact field names from API responses
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** fix frontend code if it doesn't match backend, not the other way around

### 3. **ARCHITECTURE ALIGNMENT RULE**
- ‚ùå **NEVER** create new models or fields without checking existing architecture
- ‚ùå **NEVER** reference models that don't exist or have been deleted
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** review current model files before writing any code
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** check what API endpoints actually exist before calling them

### 4. **TESTING BEFORE COMPLETION RULE**
- ‚ùå **NEVER** mark a task complete without testing it works
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** test the specific functionality you just built
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** verify the server starts successfully after changes
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** test API endpoints return expected data structure

## üéØ **SYSTEMATIC TASK EXECUTION PROCESS:**

### **Before Starting ANY Task:**
1. **Read PROGRESS.txt** - Confirm what's actually complete
2. **Review current architecture** - Check what models/routes exist NOW
3. **Identify dependencies** - What needs to exist for this task to work?
4. **Define success criteria** - How will you know this task is actually done?

### **During Task Execution:**
1. **Stay in scope** - Only work on the specific checklist item
2. **Reference existing code** - Use current architecture as blueprint
3. **Test incrementally** - Test small pieces as you build
4. **Document blockers** - If you find issues, note them but don't rabbit-hole

### **Before Marking Task Complete:**
1. **Test functionality** - Prove it works with real data
2. **Check server startup** - Ensure no breaking changes
3. **Update PROGRESS.txt** - Mark specific task complete
4. **Commit with reference** - Include checklist item in commit message
5. **Verify checklist alignment** - Does completion match checklist description?

## üõë **SCOPE CREEP PREVENTION:**

### **When You Want to "Just Fix This One Thing:"**
- ‚ùå **STOP** - This is how you get off track
- ‚úÖ **ADD TO CHECKLIST** - Create new checklist item if it's important
- ‚úÖ **STAY FOCUSED** - Complete current task first
- ‚úÖ **PRIORITIZE LATER** - Address in proper order

### **When You Find Missing Dependencies:**
- ‚ùå **DON'T** build the dependency immediately
- ‚úÖ **DOCUMENT** what's missing
- ‚úÖ **CHECK CHECKLIST** - Is the dependency already listed?
- ‚úÖ **UPDATE CHECKLIST** - Add missing dependency as separate task
- ‚úÖ **REORDER TASKS** - Complete dependencies first

### **When You Want to "Improve" Something:**
- ‚ùå **DON'T** optimize or refactor during migration
- ‚úÖ **FOCUS** on making migration work
- ‚úÖ **NOTE** improvements for later
- ‚úÖ **MIGRATION FIRST** - Improvements after everything works

## üîç **TASK-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES:**

### **For "Fix Tag Model" (Next Task):**
1. **FIRST:** Review existing Tag.js - what structure exists NOW?
2. **THEN:** Review Instance.js - how should tags reference instances?
3. **THEN:** Update ONLY the Tag model - don't touch routes yet
4. **THEN:** Test tag creation in isolation - don't test full workflow yet
5. **FINALLY:** Mark complete ONLY when Tag model works with Instance model

### **For Route Updates:**
1. **FIRST:** Review existing route file - what's already there?
2. **THEN:** Check what models/endpoints the route uses
3. **THEN:** Update ONE route at a time
4. **THEN:** Test route with curl/Postman
5. **FINALLY:** Verify server starts and route returns expected data

### **For Frontend Tasks:**
1. **FIRST:** Read BACKEND_API_REFERENCE.md to understand EXACT backend structure
2. **THEN:** Test ALL backend endpoints work with curl/Postman
3. **THEN:** Review current frontend code structure
4. **THEN:** Update ONE component at a time to match backend
5. **THEN:** Test component with REAL backend data
6. **FINALLY:** If component doesn't work, fix FRONTEND code, never backend

## üìã **ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM:**

### **Start of Each Session:**
1. Read PROGRESS.txt aloud
2. Identify the SINGLE next task
3. State success criteria out loud
4. Set time estimate for task

### **During Work:**
- Reference MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md every 30 minutes
- Ask: "Am I still working on the stated task?"
- If tempted to work on something else: ADD TO CHECKLIST, STAY FOCUSED

### **End of Each Task:**
1. Update PROGRESS.txt with new completion
2. Commit with checklist reference
3. Test that server still starts
4. Read next task before stopping

### **End of Each Session:**
1. Update both PROGRESS.txt and MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md
2. Push all changes to git
3. Note any blockers discovered
4. Identify exact next task for next session

## üö´ **FORBIDDEN ACTIONS DURING MIGRATION:**

- ‚ùå Creating new database models not in checklist
- ‚ùå Adding new frontend components not in checklist  
- ‚ùå "Improving" existing working code
- ‚ùå Working on multiple tasks simultaneously
- ‚ùå Skipping testing because "it looks right"
- ‚ùå Frontend work before backend is complete
- ‚ùå Marking tasks complete without actual verification

## üö® **ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN DURING FRONTEND WORK:**

- ‚ùå **NEVER** modify backend models during frontend development
- ‚ùå **NEVER** change API response structures to fit frontend preferences
- ‚ùå **NEVER** add backend endpoints during frontend work
- ‚ùå **NEVER** modify database schema for frontend convenience
- ‚ùå **NEVER** change working backend code because frontend "expects" different data
- ‚ùå **NEVER** work on backend files when task is frontend-focused

## ‚úÖ **SUCCESS INDICATORS:**

- ‚úÖ PROGRESS.txt updated after each task
- ‚úÖ Git commits reference specific checklist items
- ‚úÖ Server starts successfully after each task
- ‚úÖ Each task has been actually tested
- ‚úÖ No scope creep or rabbit holes
- ‚úÖ Steady progress through checklist in order

---

## üí° **REMEMBER:**
**Migration success = Systematic completion of defined tasks**
**NOT = Creative problem solving or feature improvements**

The goal is to get from broken architecture to working architecture by completing each task in order. Innovation and improvements come AFTER migration is complete.
