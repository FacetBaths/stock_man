# CURRENT TASK - Phase 9: Production Database Migration Utility

## Task Overview
**Phase:** 9 - Production Database Migration  
**Task:** Complete Frontend Migration for Remaining Components  
**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Completion Date:** 2025-08-28 15:01 UTC

## New Current Task
**Phase:** 9 - Production Database Migration Utility Development  
**Task:** Build comprehensive database migration utility to convert SQLite to MongoDB  
**Status:** IN_PROGRESS  
**Start Date:** 2025-08-28 15:15 UTC

## Success Criteria

### 1. Migration Utility Development ✓ (In Progress)
- [ ] Complete schema analysis and mapping documentation
- [ ] Build core migration engine with error handling
- [ ] Implement data validation and integrity checks
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Implement rollback mechanisms
- [ ] Document migration procedures

### 2. Data Migration Components ✓ (Planned)
- [ ] Customer data migration (SQLite customers → MongoDB Tag.customer_name)
- [ ] Product/Tool migration (SQLite products/tools → MongoDB SKU)
- [ ] Inventory migration (SQLite items → MongoDB Instance + Inventory)
- [ ] Tag migration (SQLite tags → MongoDB Tag with Instance references)
- [ ] Category migration (SQLite categories → MongoDB Category)
- [ ] User migration (if applicable)

### 3. Testing and Validation ✓ (Planned)
- [ ] Unit tests for all migration functions
- [ ] Integration tests for complete migration flow
- [ ] Data integrity validation tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Rollback procedure testing

### 4. Production Readiness ✓ (Planned)
- [ ] Migration utility packaging
- [ ] Deployment procedures documentation
- [ ] Pre-migration backup procedures
- [ ] Post-migration verification procedures
- [ ] Emergency rollback procedures

## Current Focus
Currently working on: **Migration Planning and Schema Analysis**

## Next Steps
1. Complete migration planning documents
2. Analyze legacy SQLite database schema
3. Create detailed schema mapping documentation
4. Begin development of migration utility core

## Technical Notes
- New MongoDB schema analyzed and documented
- Key models: SKU, Instance, Tag, Inventory, Category, User, AuditLog
- Migration will preserve all business logic and data relationships
- Focus on data integrity and transaction safety

## Risk Assessment
- **Data Loss Risk:** MEDIUM - Comprehensive backup and rollback procedures required
- **Downtime Risk:** LOW - Migration can be performed offline with proper scheduling
- **Complexity Risk:** HIGH - Complex data relationships require careful mapping

## Dependencies
- Completed frontend migration (✓ COMPLETE)
- New MongoDB models tested and validated
- Legacy SQLite database access
- Production deployment environment access
