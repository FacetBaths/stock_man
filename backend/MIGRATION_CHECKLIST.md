## Risk Mitigation Items

### Critical Risks
- **Data Loss:** Complete backups, tested rollback procedures, transaction safety
- **Extended Downtime:** Thorough testing, staged deployment, quick rollback capability
- **Data Integrity Issues:** Comprehensive validation, business rule verification
- **Performance Degradation:** Benchmarking, optimization, monitoring

### Contingency Plans
- **Migration Failure:** Immediate rollback to SQLite with data preservation
- **Partial Migration:** Data reconciliation procedures and manual correction processes
- **Performance Issues:** Query optimization and database tuning procedures
- **User Acceptance Issues:** Training materials and support procedures
